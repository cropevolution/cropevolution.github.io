title: "What we read"

&nbsp;

This page is intended for our future weekly journal club. 
The format for this journal club will probably be informal in a coffee place or pub with open discussion on the paper and beyond in a relaxed atmosphere. 
Anybody will be invited to join us.
Until this journal club actually exists (starting late April 2019) I will put up a weekly paper that I would suggest, feel free to email me for discssion, questions or suggesions.
