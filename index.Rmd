Welcome to the Stetter lab in the [Institute for Plant Sciences](http://www.botanik.uni-koeln.de/1634.html?&L=1) at the [University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de/). 
We are interested in crop evolution and adaptation. We study the incomplete domestication of the South American pseudo-cereal, amaranth, and the domestication and cultivation history of maize. We use population and quantitative genetic methods to understand how wild plants became crops and how these crops spread across the globe. 

[**WE ARE HIRING**](PhDposition_Stetter.pdf) a PhD student in evolutionary genetics within the newly established Collaborative Research Center on Plant Ecological Genetics

Read more about our [research](research.html) and who we are on this site. If you like what we do and would like to join the lab please contact [Markus](mailto:m.stetter@uni-koeln.de) to find out more about openings and possibilities to apply for fellowships.

Our lab is also a member of the Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences ([CEPLAS](https://www.ceplas.eu/en/research/principal-investigators/dr-markus-stetter/)). 
In this video we give some insight how we contribute to the goal of CEPLAS, "SMART Plants for Tomorrowâ€™s Needs"
